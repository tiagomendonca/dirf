\usage{
distances(rf)
}
\arguments{
\item{rf}{A Random Forest object created using the \code{ranger} package. The model must have the \code{write.forest}
parameter set to \code{TRUE} during training to enable access to tree structures.}
}
\value{
A data table with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{tree}: The tree index (integer).
\item \code{node1}: The first node in the distance pair (0-based index).
\item \code{node2}: The second node in the distance pair (0-based index).
\item \code{distance}: The computed distance between \code{node1} and \code{node2} for the given tree.
}
}
\description{
Calculates the distances between nodes for all trees in a Random Forest model. These distances can be
used for advanced analyses, such as weighting predictions based on proximity in the tree structure.

# Generate example data
set.seed(123)
df1 <- tibble::tibble(
  x1 = stats::runif(20, 0, 1),
  x2 = stats::rnorm(20, 0, 1),
  y = 2 * x1 + 1.5 * x2 + stats::rnorm(20, 0, 1)

# Fit a Random Forest model

  y ~ .,
  data = df1,
  max.depth = 5,
  num.trees = 10,
  write.forest = TRUE
)

# Calculate distances between nodes
