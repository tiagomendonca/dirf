\title{distances_rf}
\usage{
distances_rf(rf, n_tree)
}
\arguments{
\item{rf}{A Random Forest object created using the \code{ranger} package. The model must be trained with \code{write.forest = TRUE}.}

\item{n_tree}{An integer specifying the index of the tree within the Random Forest for which to calculate node distances.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{node1}: The first node in the pair (integer).
\item \code{node2}: The second node in the pair (integer).
\item \code{dist}: The calculated distance between \code{node1} and \code{node2}.
}
}
\description{
Calculates the pairwise distances between the nodes of a specific tree in a Random Forest model.
The distances are computed based on the tree's structure and are useful for advanced analyses,
such as measuring relationships or proximity between terminal nodes.

# Generate example data
set.seed(123)
